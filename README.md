### Airbnb Udacity
As part of the Udacity data science nanodegree course, I have to analyse the Airbnb Seattle dataset for 2016 following the CRISP-DM process.


## Installation 

This project utilizes default packages within the Anaconda distribution of Python for the majority of the analysis. 

We are mainly using two libraries
1. pandas
2. matplotlib

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.


## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:

1. What are the busiest time of the year
2. Price changes due to the weekend and use prices to find the peak season
3. Analyze Seattle neighbourhoods by price and occupancy rate

## Results
I have mentioned detailed results in a medium blog mentioned below
